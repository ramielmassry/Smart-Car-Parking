- This project aims to represent a well-designed and structured 3D smart car parking system that comes with the following properties:
1) LCD at the gate to inform you about the available number of places.
2) Fire System Alert.
3) Light system.
4) Servo motor that open the gate.
5) Sensors that detect the entering and exiting of the cars.
6) Sensors that detect number of cars.
7) Webserver that controls the light system of the car parking system and monitors the numbers of available places in the garage. A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP, the network protocol created to distribute web pages, or its secure variant HTTPS.

- Electronic Components:
1) ESP32
2) Servo Motor
3) 7x line follower sensor
4) Flame sensor
5)Buzzer
6) LCD display
7) I2C module
8) LEDs
